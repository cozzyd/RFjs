some jsroot-based signal-processing functions. Originally this was part of monutau (https://github.com/beaconTau/monutau) but I have moved it out so it may be more easily used by multiple projects.

Requires jsroot (https://github.com/root-project/jsroot) and incorporate an emscriptened KissFFT from KissFFT-js (https://github.com/j-funk/kissfft-js)

To use, you'll need something like this before any of your scripts: 

    <script type="text/javascript" src="jsroot/scripts/JSRootCore.js?2d&hierarchy&io&tree"> </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="KissFFT.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="FFT.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="rf.js"></script>
